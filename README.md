# Louise, Your Custom Kickstarter Analysis Report

Congratulations, Louise, on your diverse range of Kickstarter ventures! We are thrilled to provide you with analytical data that will help you determine how to focus your marketing and communication resources for further campaigns as requested.

In order to provide this information to you, we analyzed 3016 unique pieces of data on fundraising campaigns of interest to your organization.  54% of the campaigns you are examining have been successful in meeting their fundraising goals, an exceptional accomplishment for any grassroots fundraising endeavor.

## Your top performers

Your campaigns were analyzed by category and it was clearly determined that theater and music are your organization's fundraising strengths.

Within these categories, you strove to examine new ventures in the United Kingdom. The following analyses will guide you in being successful in these endeavors:
* Per capita investment in UK based productions is maximized at a rate of under 2000 pounds per donation. 
* The funding audience can be fickle -- allocating resources to programs they are committed to see.  Market research with prospoective funders is a necessity for success in UK markets.

### Challenge

Our analysis team took up the challenge of providing some supportive advanced analytics for you to help spark your creative juices for future fundraising campaigns.  In this analysis, we specifically want to determine: 
1. What the relationship is between your project's success and your initial goals for the same projects and 
2. How successful your programs are based on the dates you launched them.

While your play Fever acheived 86% of it's fundraising goal in just under a month, you launched 697 other Kickstarter campaigns that reached or exceeded their pre-determined fundraising goals (where at 100% of funding or more).  Let's examine your overall success first and then go a little deeper in detail.

### Overall Success with Kickstarter Campaigns

Of all the different Kickstarter campaigns that you convened in the time period, the following line graph depicts your outcomes at reaching intended fundraising goals.

You may observe from the visualization above, that: 
  * Kickstarter campaigns with smaller financial goals (relative to the spectrum of goals set) were more likely to be successful. 
  * Campaigns between $15,000 and $45,000 trended near each other in whether or not they would succeed or fail. 
  * Campaigns with goals of more than $45,000 were much more likely to fail at reaching their fundraising goals than succeed. 
  
In summary, the goal that was established has a relationship with the success or failure of your campaign, and this finding should be noted in future campaigns.

### Program Success by Time of Year it Was Launched 

Of particular interest to your research goals, is the success of campaigns to your specific category "Theater", which includes the subcategories of plays, musicals, and spaces.   It provides additional guidance to what might be your most successful season for launching theater based campaigns.

As you can see from the graph preceeding:
* Plays that are launched in May are significantly more likely to reach their goals than any other month of the year. The proximal months of April, June and July are also strong months for acheiving goal success.
* Plays launched in December are near equally likely to succeed (n=37) or fail (n=35) based on past play performance. 

In summary, your Kickstarter campaigns will have a seasonality that will be interwoven with their success. It is important to be mindful of that as you launch new campaigns.

### Relating Launch Date with Fundraising Goals

Given the impact of your launch date on the success of your Kickstarter Campaigns, we wanted to take a closer look at the performance of campaigns specifically for plays in your theater category to assess if timing was a variable that could distinguish whether or not your fundraiser would succeed or not.  We qualified a play as being a member of the "midrange" fundraising category if its goals fell between the dollar amounts of $15,000 and $45,000.

* In this visualization, you can see that launch date might have an impact on the success of your plays with goals that fall in the mid-range.  
* The data compiled has a small n of only 73 pieces of data, however, of those 73 plays, those launched in September were notably more likely to reach their goals than any other month. 
* If you want to task a risk on a play that you are really excited about -- your past data would advise you to launch that play in a month that is atypical based on your other success based data. 

### Relating Campaign Length to Fundraising Success

Finally, we noted earlier in the analysis that Fever was modestly successful having reached 86% of its fundraising goal in less than a month, we wanted to explore of campaign length influenced the success or failure of a campaign, specifically for the Plays for which you are raising funds.

Based on this analysis, it does not appear that there is a significant impact on a plays campaign success based on the runtime of the campaign.  The data doesn't necessarily affirm that your most popular 30 day fundraising window is more or less successful than any other runtime based on the extant data set (which only contains 73 points for analysis).
