# Louise, Your Custom Kickstarter Analysis Report

Congratulations, Louise, on your diverse range of Kickstarter ventures! We are thrilled to provide you with analytical data that will help you determine how to focus your marketing and communication resources for further campaigns as requested.

In order to provide this information to you, we analyzed 3016 unique pieces of data on fundraising campaigns of interest to your organization.  54% of the campaigns you are examining have been successful in meeting their fundraising goals, an exceptional accomplishment for any grassroots fundraising endeavor.

## Your top performers

Your campaigns were analyzed by category and it was clearly determined that theater and music are your organization's fundraising strengths.

Within these categories, you strove to examine new ventures in the United Kingdom. The following analyses will guide you in being successful in these endeavors:
* Per capita investment in UK based productions is maximized at a rate of under 2000 pounds per donation. 
* The funding audience can be fickle -- allocating resources to programs they are committed to see.  Market research with prospoective funders is a necessity for success in UK markets.

### Challenge

So, our analysis team took up the challenge of providing some supportive advanced analytics for you to help spark your creative juices for future fundraising campaigns.  In this analysis, we specifically want to determine: 
1. What the relationship is between your project's success and your initial goals for the same projects and 
2. How successful your programs are based on the dates you launched them.

This information will be incredibly supportive in future decisionmaking. 

While your play Fever acheived 86% of it's fundraising goal in just under a month, you launched 697 other plays that reached or exceeded your determined fundraising goals.  Let's examine your overall success first and then delve a little deeper into your programmatic successes.

This graph will help you examine how the goals you set for a program influence its success at meeting intended fundraising goals.

You may observe from this visualization: 
  * Plays that successful met their fundraising goals, had lower dollar amount goals in the spectrum of goals.  
  * Plays between $15,000 and $45,000 were nearly equivalent in their rates of success.
  * Plays with goals of more than $45,000 were much more likely to fail at reaching their fundraising goals than succeed. 

This graph informs us about your overall programmatic success for the Category "Theater".  This category includes your plays, musicals, and spaces.   It provides additional guidance to what might be your most successful theater season for launching your campaigns.

As you can see from the graph:
* Plays that are launched in May are significantly more likely to reach their goals than any other month of the year. The proximal months of April, June and July are also strong months for acheiving goal success.
* Plays launched in December are near qually likely to succeed (n=37) or fail (n=35) based on past play performance. 


Given the impact of launch date on the success of your programming, we wanted to take a closer look at how your play performance acted as an influencer in your plays that had those midrange fundraising goals between $15,000 and $45,000.

If you desire to pursue a play that falls in the mid-range fundraising category, you are more likely to acheive success at meeting your fundraising goals in the fall month of September than any other month.  If you want to task a risk on a play that you are really excited about -- your past data would advise you to launch that play in a month that is atypical based on your other success based data.
